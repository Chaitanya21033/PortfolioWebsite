## Hey There

I created a portfolio website using React JS as the primary development framework. The website showcases my skills and experience in web development, as well as provides examples of my past work. The website was built using React's powerful component-based architecture, which allowed me to easily create reusable and modular code. This helped me to develop a dynamic and interactive website that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Additionally, the use of React allowed me to efficiently manage the website's state and update the UI in real-time, providing a smooth user experience
